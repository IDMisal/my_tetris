# Welcome to My Tetris
***

## Task
The task is to create a fully functional Tetris game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
The challenge involves implementing the game logic, including tetromino movement, rotation, collision detection, line clearing, scoring, and game-over conditions. 
Additionally, the game must adhere to specific guidelines for colors, controls, and features.

## Description
The problem has been solved by developing a Tetris game with the following components:
- index.html: The main HTML file containing the canvas element and game controls.
- style.css: The CSS file for styling the game interface.
- controller.js: Handles user input and game controls.
- renderer.js: Renders the game board and tetrominoes on the canvas.
- my_tetris.js: Contains the game logic, including tetromino movement, rotation, collision detection, line clearing, scoring, and game-over conditions.
The game uses an event-driven architecture to handle user interactions and update the game state accordingly. 
The tetrominoes are rendered on a 10x20 playfield with a variety of colors, and the game provides real-time feedback, including score updates and a game-over message.

## Installation
To install the project, clone the repository and ensure you have a compatible web browser to run the game. 
No additional installation steps are required since the game is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage
To start the game, open the index.html file in your web browser. Use the following controls to play the game:
    1. Arrow keys for movement (left, right, down)
    2. Up arrow or 'X' key to rotate clockwise
    3. 'Z' key to rotate counterclockwise
    4. Spacebar to hard drop
    5. 'Shift' or 'C' to hold the current piece
    6. 'Esc' or 'F1' to pause the game
